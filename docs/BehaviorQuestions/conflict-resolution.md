# Conflict Resolution

Conflict resolution questions assess how you handle disagreements, navigate difficult conversations, and maintain professional relationships.

## Common Questions

### Q1: Tell me about a time you disagreed with a coworker's approach.

**What they're looking for:**
- Respectful disagreement
- Focus on the problem, not the person
- Ability to reach resolution

**Example Answer (STAR):**

> **Situation:** Our team was deciding how to handle error logging. My teammate wanted to use a third-party service, while I believed we should build an in-house solution.
>
> **Task:** I needed to present my perspective effectively while remaining open to other viewpoints.
>
> **Action:** Instead of pushing my opinion in the meeting, I asked if we could both prepare a short comparison. I created a doc listing pros and cons of each approach, including cost, maintenance burden, and team expertise. During our follow-up discussion, I focused on asking questions about their concerns rather than defending my position. I discovered their main worry was the time investment of building in-house.
>
> **Result:** We reached a compromise: use the third-party service for now with an abstraction layer that would allow us to swap it out later. This addressed both concerns—quick implementation and future flexibility. The decision has held up well for two years.

### Q2: Describe a time you had a conflict with your manager.

**What they're looking for:**
- Professionalism when disagreeing with authority
- Ability to advocate for yourself or your team
- Respect for hierarchy while maintaining integrity

**Example Answer (STAR):**

> **Situation:** My manager wanted to commit to an aggressive deadline for a feature that I knew was technically risky. They had already tentatively agreed to the timeline with leadership.
>
> **Task:** I needed to express my concerns without undermining their credibility or coming across as unwilling to work hard.
>
> **Action:** I requested a private 1:1 rather than raising it in a team meeting. I came prepared with data: a breakdown of the technical work, historical velocity, and a list of risks. I framed it as "I want to help us succeed" rather than "this is wrong." I also proposed alternatives—either reduce scope or add a buffer for the riskiest parts.
>
> **Result:** My manager appreciated the data-driven approach and went back to leadership with a revised timeline. We delivered on the new schedule without the burnout that would have come from the original deadline. My manager later told me they valued that I had raised concerns privately with solutions rather than problems.

### Q3: Tell me about a time you had to give difficult feedback.

**What they're looking for:**
- Courage to have hard conversations
- Empathy and tact
- Focus on improvement, not criticism

**Example Answer (STAR):**

> **Situation:** A teammate's code reviews were consistently harsh in tone—using words like "wrong" and "you should have known"—and it was affecting team morale.
>
> **Task:** As someone they respected, I felt I should address this before it escalated or someone complained formally.
>
> **Action:** I invited them to lunch to keep it casual. I started with positive observations about their technical contributions. Then I shared specific examples of review comments that had landed poorly, without naming who was affected. I explained the impact: "When comments feel critical, people become defensive rather than receptive." I suggested alternatives like "Have you considered..." or "What do you think about...".
>
> **Result:** They were initially surprised but receptive. They admitted they wrote reviews the way they'd received them at a previous company. Over the next month, I noticed a clear shift in their communication style. Team members started engaging more in code reviews, and we saw faster iteration times.

### Q4: Describe a situation where two stakeholders had conflicting requirements.

**What they're looking for:**
- Ability to navigate competing priorities
- Stakeholder management skills
- Creative problem-solving

**Example Answer (STAR):**

> **Situation:** Product wanted to launch a new feature ASAP to beat a competitor. Security required a full audit that would take three weeks.
>
> **Task:** As the tech lead, I needed to find a path that satisfied both requirements without delaying launch or compromising security.
>
> **Action:** I facilitated a meeting with both stakeholders to understand their core concerns. Product's real deadline was a specific industry event. Security's concern was mainly around the payment integration. I proposed a phased launch: release the feature without payment integration for the event, complete the security audit in parallel, and enable payments two weeks later.
>
> **Result:** We launched at the event with core functionality, generating significant user interest. Payments went live after the audit, catching any early issues with low-risk users first. Both stakeholders felt heard, and this became our template for future feature launches.

### Q5: Tell me about a time you had to work with someone you didn't get along with.

**What they're looking for:**
- Professionalism despite personal differences
- Ability to separate personal feelings from work
- Focus on outcomes over relationships

**Example Answer (STAR):**

> **Situation:** I was assigned to a project with a developer whose working style was very different from mine. They preferred to work in isolation, rarely documented anything, and often made unilateral decisions.
>
> **Task:** I needed to deliver the project successfully while finding a way to collaborate effectively.
>
> **Action:** Instead of trying to change their style, I adapted my approach. I scheduled short, focused syncs rather than long meetings. I started keeping my own notes on their verbal decisions to create documentation. When decisions affected my work, I specifically asked "Do you need input from me on this, or is it in your domain?" to clarify boundaries. I focused on respecting their autonomy while ensuring alignment.
>
> **Result:** We delivered the project on time. While we never became close friends, we developed mutual respect for each other's contributions. I learned that effective collaboration doesn't require personal connection—it requires clear communication and respect for differences.

## Key Themes to Demonstrate

| Theme | How to Show It |
|-------|----------------|
| **Professionalism** | Keeping disagreements focused on issues, not people |
| **Active Listening** | Understanding the other person's perspective before responding |
| **Solution-Oriented** | Always bringing alternatives, not just objections |
| **Emotional Intelligence** | Reading the room, choosing appropriate times for difficult conversations |
| **Integrity** | Standing firm on important issues while being flexible on approach |

## The RIGHT Way to Handle Conflict

1. **Assume good intent** - Most conflicts arise from miscommunication or different priorities, not malice
2. **Address it early** - Small issues become big issues when ignored
3. **Focus on interests, not positions** - Understand WHY someone wants something
4. **Separate people from problems** - Criticize ideas, not individuals
5. **Seek win-win** - Look for solutions that address both parties' core concerns

## Stories to Prepare

Have at least 2-3 stories ready that demonstrate:

- [ ] Disagreeing respectfully with a peer
- [ ] Navigating disagreement with someone more senior
- [ ] Mediating between conflicting parties
- [ ] Giving or receiving difficult feedback
- [ ] Working productively despite interpersonal friction
