# Behavior Questions

Behavioral interviews assess how you've handled situations in the past to predict future performance. These questions typically start with phrases like "Tell me about a time when..." or "Give me an example of..."

## Why Behavioral Questions Matter

- **Past behavior predicts future behavior** - Employers want concrete examples, not hypotheticals
- **Reveals soft skills** - Communication, teamwork, problem-solving, adaptability
- **Differentiates candidates** - Technical skills can be similar; how you work with others sets you apart
- **Common in tech interviews** - Most FAANG and tech companies include behavioral rounds

## What Interviewers Evaluate

| Competency | What They Look For |
|------------|-------------------|
| **Communication** | Clear, structured responses; active listening |
| **Teamwork** | Collaboration, supporting others, handling diverse perspectives |
| **Leadership** | Taking initiative, influencing without authority, mentoring |
| **Problem-Solving** | Analytical thinking, creativity, learning from failures |
| **Adaptability** | Handling change, ambiguity, and pressure |
| **Conflict Resolution** | Managing disagreements professionally |

## How to Prepare

1. **Learn the STAR Method** - A structured way to answer behavioral questions
2. **Prepare 8-10 stories** - Cover different competencies with real examples
3. **Quantify results** - Use metrics when possible ("reduced load time by 40%")
