# Leadership

Leadership questions assess your ability to influence others, take initiative, and drive results—even without formal authority.

## Common Questions

### Q1: Tell me about a time you led a project or initiative.

**What they're looking for:**
- Ability to organize and coordinate work
- Communication with stakeholders
- Driving outcomes, not just tasks

**Example Answer (STAR):**

> **Situation:** Our team's deployment process was manual and error-prone, causing weekly incidents. No one owned the problem because it crossed multiple team boundaries.
>
> **Task:** Though I wasn't a manager, I decided to take ownership of improving our deployment pipeline.
>
> **Action:** I started by documenting the current process and identifying pain points with each team. I wrote an RFC proposing an automated CI/CD pipeline and got buy-in from engineering leadership. I organized a working group with volunteers from different teams, assigning tasks based on expertise. I ran weekly syncs to track progress and unblock issues. When we hit resistance from ops about changing their workflow, I spent time understanding their concerns and adjusted the rollout plan.
>
> **Result:** We reduced deployment time from 4 hours to 20 minutes and eliminated configuration-related incidents entirely. The project became a template for future cross-team initiatives, and I was asked to lead our platform team based on this work.

### Q2: Describe a time you had to influence without authority.

**What they're looking for:**
- Persuasion through expertise and relationships
- Building coalitions
- Getting results without direct reports

**Example Answer (STAR):**

> **Situation:** Our API response times were degrading, but the performance work kept getting deprioritized in favor of new features. I wasn't a tech lead, so I couldn't unilaterally change our roadmap.
>
> **Task:** I needed to convince product and engineering leadership that performance work was urgent without seeming like I was just complaining.
>
> **Action:** I gathered data: response time trends, correlation with user drop-off, and support ticket volume related to slowness. I calculated the revenue impact of users abandoning slow pages. I presented this to the product manager in a 1:1, framing it as "I found something that might be affecting our metrics." Then I proposed a specific, time-boxed performance sprint with measurable goals. I offered to lead the effort so it wouldn't burden other initiatives.
>
> **Result:** Product approved a two-week performance sprint. We improved p95 response times by 60%, and user session duration increased by 15%. Leadership started including performance metrics in quarterly planning, and I was invited to participate in roadmap discussions going forward.

### Q3: Tell me about a time you mentored someone.

**What they're looking for:**
- Investment in others' growth
- Teaching and communication skills
- Patience and adaptability

**Example Answer (STAR):**

> **Situation:** A junior developer joined our team and was struggling to ramp up. They were talented but overwhelmed by our complex codebase and hesitant to ask questions.
>
> **Task:** I volunteered to be their unofficial mentor to help them become productive and confident.
>
> **Action:** I started with weekly 1:1s focused on their questions and concerns, creating a safe space to admit confusion. I assigned them progressively challenging tasks, always available for pairing. I shared my own early struggles to normalize the learning curve. When they made mistakes, I helped them debug without judgment and turned errors into learning moments. I also connected them with other team members who could help with specific areas.
>
> **Result:** Within three months, they went from needing constant guidance to independently shipping features. They're now mentoring new hires themselves. They told me in their peer feedback that my mentorship was the main reason they stayed at the company during a difficult first year.

### Q4: Describe a situation where you had to make a difficult decision quickly.

**What they're looking for:**
- Decision-making under pressure
- Balancing speed with thoughtfulness
- Taking responsibility for outcomes

**Example Answer (STAR):**

> **Situation:** During a production incident, we discovered a data corruption bug affecting a subset of users. We had two options: take the service offline to fix it (affecting all users) or continue operating while fixing it (risking more corruption).
>
> **Task:** As the on-call engineer, I needed to make a call quickly while the senior engineers were being paged.
>
> **Action:** I spent 5 minutes assessing the blast radius—about 2% of users were affected, but the corruption rate was accelerating. I decided to take the service offline, documented my reasoning in the incident channel, and started the fix. When the senior engineer joined, I briefed them quickly and they agreed with my call. I also proactively notified customer support so they could handle incoming complaints.
>
> **Result:** We had 15 minutes of downtime instead of potentially hours of data cleanup. Post-incident review confirmed the decision was correct—the corruption would have spread to 20% of users if left running. Leadership cited my quick decision-making in the incident review as why the impact was limited.

### Q5: Tell me about a time you had to motivate a struggling team.

**What they're looking for:**
- Emotional intelligence and empathy
- Ability to rally others
- Focus on team success, not personal credit

**Example Answer (STAR):**

> **Situation:** Midway through a critical project, two key team members left the company. Morale was low, deadlines hadn't changed, and the remaining team was demoralized and overworked.
>
> **Task:** Though I wasn't the manager, I was the most senior engineer remaining and felt responsible for keeping the team together.
>
> **Action:** I organized a team meeting where we honestly discussed the situation—not to complain, but to acknowledge reality. I worked with the PM to reprioritize, making hard cuts to scope that I presented as "here's what we're choosing to do well vs. not at all." I introduced small wins by breaking the work into weekly milestones with visible progress. I also made sure to celebrate each milestone, even just with a Slack acknowledgment. When people worked late, I stayed too, and when I saw burnout, I explicitly told people to take a day off.
>
> **Result:** We delivered the core project on time with high quality. The team's engagement scores actually improved in the next survey. Two team members later told me my leadership during that period was why they didn't start job hunting. I learned that visible, consistent support matters more than grand gestures.

## Key Themes to Demonstrate

| Theme | How to Show It |
|-------|----------------|
| **Vision** | Seeing what needs to be done and articulating why it matters |
| **Initiative** | Taking ownership without being asked |
| **Influence** | Getting buy-in through data, relationships, and persuasion |
| **Accountability** | Owning outcomes, including failures |
| **Development** | Growing others and building team capability |

## Leadership Without a Title

You don't need to be a manager to demonstrate leadership:

- **Take initiative** - See a problem? Propose a solution
- **Build consensus** - Get others excited about your ideas
- **Mentor others** - Share your knowledge generously
- **Improve processes** - Make the team more effective
- **Own outcomes** - Take responsibility for results, not just tasks

## Stories to Prepare

Have at least 2-3 stories ready that demonstrate:

- [ ] Leading a project or initiative
- [ ] Influencing without formal authority
- [ ] Mentoring or developing others
- [ ] Making tough decisions under pressure
- [ ] Rallying a team through difficulty
