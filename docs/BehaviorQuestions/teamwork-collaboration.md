# Teamwork & Collaboration

Teamwork questions assess how you work with others, contribute to group success, and handle diverse perspectives.

## Common Questions

### Q1: Tell me about a time you worked on a cross-functional team.

**What they're looking for:**
- Ability to communicate with non-technical stakeholders
- Understanding different perspectives
- Collaboration across disciplines

**Example Answer (STAR):**

> **Situation:** At my previous company, we needed to redesign our checkout flow. The project involved engineers, designers, product managers, and the marketing team.
>
> **Task:** As the frontend lead, I needed to implement the new design while coordinating with all stakeholders to ensure their requirements were met.
>
> **Action:** I set up weekly syncs with design to clarify edge cases early. I created a shared Notion doc where product could track feature status. When marketing had last-minute requests for A/B testing hooks, I proposed a flexible component architecture that could accommodate their needs without delaying launch. I also organized a "show and tell" session where I demoed progress to the whole group.
>
> **Result:** We launched 2 days early, and conversion improved by 18%. The marketing team said it was the smoothest collaboration they'd had with engineering.

### Q2: Describe a situation where you had to work with someone difficult.

**What they're looking for:**
- Emotional intelligence
- Conflict resolution skills
- Professionalism under pressure

**Example Answer (STAR):**

> **Situation:** On a previous project, I was paired with a senior developer who was dismissive of my ideas and often made changes to my code without discussion.
>
> **Task:** I needed to find a way to work productively together while maintaining code quality and team morale.
>
> **Action:** Instead of escalating immediately, I asked for a 1:1 to understand their perspective. I learned they were under pressure from leadership and were worried about the project timeline. I proposed we do brief code reviews before making changes, framing it as helping me learn from their experience. I also started sending short summaries of my approach before implementing, so they had visibility.
>
> **Result:** Our working relationship improved significantly. They started including me in design decisions, and I learned a lot from their feedback. The project was delivered successfully, and they later recommended me for a promotion.

### Q3: Tell me about a time you helped a teammate who was struggling.

**What they're looking for:**
- Empathy and support for others
- Initiative in helping the team succeed
- Mentoring ability

**Example Answer (STAR):**

> **Situation:** A new junior developer on my team was struggling to complete their tasks and seemed overwhelmed during our sprint.
>
> **Task:** While not formally their mentor, I wanted to help them succeed without undermining their confidence or taking over their work.
>
> **Action:** I invited them for coffee and asked open-ended questions about how things were going. They admitted feeling lost in our codebase. I offered to do a "codebase tour" session, walking through our architecture and key patterns. I also suggested we pair program on their current task. I made sure to let them drive while I asked guiding questions rather than giving solutions.
>
> **Result:** Within two weeks, their velocity doubled. They told me the codebase tour was more helpful than all the documentation. I've since made this tour a standard part of onboarding, and three other team members have adopted the practice.

### Q4: Give an example of when you had to rely on others to complete a task.

**What they're looking for:**
- Ability to delegate and trust others
- Communication and coordination skills
- Recognition of team contributions

**Example Answer (STAR):**

> **Situation:** I was leading a migration from our legacy API to a new GraphQL service, but I was also the only one with deep knowledge of the legacy system.
>
> **Task:** I needed to transfer enough knowledge to the team so they could handle the migration while I focused on the most complex parts.
>
> **Action:** I created detailed documentation of the legacy system's quirks and held knowledge-transfer sessions. I identified which team members' strengths matched specific migration tasks. I set up a Slack channel for quick questions and committed to responding within 2 hours. I trusted them to make decisions and only asked to be looped in on breaking changes.
>
> **Result:** The team completed 70% of the migration without my direct involvement. We finished two sprints ahead of schedule. Two teammates said the project helped them level up significantly, and both have since led migrations themselves.

---

### Q5: Describe a time you received critical feedback from a teammate.

**What they're looking for:**
- Openness to feedback
- Growth mindset
- Ability to separate ego from work

**Example Answer (STAR):**

> **Situation:** During a code review, a teammate pointed out that my PR was well-written but very difficult to review because it was too large and touched too many areas.
>
> **Task:** I needed to address this feedback constructively and improve my PR practices.
>
> **Action:** Instead of being defensive, I thanked them for the feedback and asked for specific suggestions. They recommended breaking large changes into smaller, focused PRs. I went back and split my PR into 4 smaller ones, each with a clear scope. I also started using draft PRs for early feedback on large changes.
>
> **Result:** Review turnaround time improved from 2 days to same-day for most of my PRs. Other team members adopted the practice, and we added PR size guidelines to our team working agreement. The teammate who gave feedback became one of my go-to reviewers.
