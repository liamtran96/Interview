# Teamwork & Collaboration

Teamwork questions assess how you work with others, contribute to group success, and handle diverse perspectives.

## Common Questions

### Q1: Tell me about a time you worked on a cross-functional team.

**What they're looking for:**
- Ability to communicate with non-technical stakeholders
- Understanding different perspectives
- Collaboration across disciplines

**Example Answer (STAR):**

> **Situation:** At my previous company, we needed to redesign our checkout flow. The project involved engineers, designers, product managers, and the marketing team.
>
> **Task:** As the frontend lead, I needed to implement the new design while coordinating with all stakeholders to ensure their requirements were met.
>
> **Action:** I set up weekly syncs with design to clarify edge cases early. I created a shared Notion doc where product could track feature status. When marketing had last-minute requests for A/B testing hooks, I proposed a flexible component architecture that could accommodate their needs without delaying launch. I also organized a "show and tell" session where I demoed progress to the whole group.
>
> **Result:** We launched 2 days early, and conversion improved by 18%. The marketing team said it was the smoothest collaboration they'd had with engineering.

### Q2: Describe a situation where you had to work with someone difficult.

**What they're looking for:**
- Emotional intelligence
- Conflict resolution skills
- Professionalism under pressure

**Example Answer (STAR):**

> **Situation:** On a previous project, I was paired with a senior developer who was dismissive of my ideas and often made changes to my code without discussion.
>
> **Task:** I needed to find a way to work productively together while maintaining code quality and team morale.
>
> **Action:** Instead of escalating immediately, I asked for a 1:1 to understand their perspective. I learned they were under pressure from leadership and were worried about the project timeline. I proposed we do brief code reviews before making changes, framing it as helping me learn from their experience. I also started sending short summaries of my approach before implementing, so they had visibility.
>
> **Result:** Our working relationship improved significantly. They started including me in design decisions, and I learned a lot from their feedback. The project was delivered successfully, and they later recommended me for a promotion.

---

### Q3: Tell me about a time you helped a teammate who was struggling.

**What they're looking for:**
- Empathy and support for others
- Initiative in helping the team succeed
- Mentoring ability

**Example Answer (STAR):**

> **Situation:** A new junior developer on my team was struggling to complete their tasks and seemed overwhelmed during our sprint.
>
> **Task:** While not formally their mentor, I wanted to help them succeed without undermining their confidence or taking over their work.
>
> **Action:** I invited them for coffee and asked open-ended questions about how things were going. They admitted feeling lost in our codebase. I offered to do a "codebase tour" session, walking through our architecture and key patterns. I also suggested we pair program on their current task. I made sure to let them drive while I asked guiding questions rather than giving solutions.
>
> **Result:** Within two weeks, their velocity doubled. They told me the codebase tour was more helpful than all the documentation. I've since made this tour a standard part of onboarding, and three other team members have adopted the practice.

---

### Q4: Give an example of when you had to rely on others to complete a task.

**What they're looking for:**
- Ability to delegate and trust others
- Communication and coordination skills
- Recognition of team contributions

**Example Answer (STAR):**

> **Situation:** I was leading a migration from our legacy API to a new GraphQL service, but I was also the only one with deep knowledge of the legacy system.
>
> **Task:** I needed to transfer enough knowledge to the team so they could handle the migration while I focused on the most complex parts.
>
> **Action:** I created detailed documentation of the legacy system's quirks and held knowledge-transfer sessions. I identified which team members' strengths matched specific migration tasks. I set up a Slack channel for quick questions and committed to responding within 2 hours. I trusted them to make decisions and only asked to be looped in on breaking changes.
>
> **Result:** The team completed 70% of the migration without my direct involvement. We finished two sprints ahead of schedule. Two teammates said the project helped them level up significantly, and both have since led migrations themselves.

---

### Q5: Describe a time you received critical feedback from a teammate.

**What they're looking for:**
- Openness to feedback
- Growth mindset
- Ability to separate ego from work

**Example Answer (STAR):**

> **Situation:** During a code review, a teammate pointed out that my PR was well-written but very difficult to review because it was too large and touched too many areas.
>
> **Task:** I needed to address this feedback constructively and improve my PR practices.
>
> **Action:** Instead of being defensive, I thanked them for the feedback and asked for specific suggestions. They recommended breaking large changes into smaller, focused PRs. I went back and split my PR into 4 smaller ones, each with a clear scope. I also started using draft PRs for early feedback on large changes.
>
> **Result:** Review turnaround time improved from 2 days to same-day for most of my PRs. Other team members adopted the practice, and we added PR size guidelines to our team working agreement. The teammate who gave feedback became one of my go-to reviewers.

---

### Q6: Tell me about a time you had to build consensus across multiple teams.

**What they're looking for:**
- Stakeholder management across organizations
- Finding common ground
- Communication and influence

**Example Answer (STAR):**

> **Situation:** We needed to standardize our API design across four different product teams, each with their own approach and strong opinions about what "good API design" meant.
>
> **Task:** As the platform engineer, I was tasked with getting alignment on a single set of API standards.
>
> **Action:** Instead of dictating standards from the top down, I organized a working group with representatives from each team. I started by having each team present their current approach and rationale. I identified commonalities—turns out 80% of our patterns were already aligned. For the contentious 20%, I facilitated discussions focused on user experience and long-term maintenance rather than personal preference. I created RFC documents for proposed standards and gave teams two weeks to comment. I incorporated feedback and re-presented. When we still couldn't agree on REST vs GraphQL for new services, I proposed "use REST for simple CRUD, GraphQL for complex queries"—giving teams choice within guardrails.
>
> **Result:** All four teams adopted the standards. The compromise approach actually worked better than forcing one pattern. API consistency improved, which reduced onboarding time for engineers switching teams. The working group approach became our model for other cross-team initiatives. I learned that consensus requires surfacing underlying values, not just debating implementation details.

### Q7: Describe a situation where you had to contribute to a team outside your expertise.

**What they're looking for:**
- Willingness to step outside comfort zone
- Learning agility
- Adding value in unfamiliar territory

**Example Answer (STAR):**

> **Situation:** Our mobile team was short-handed right before a major release. I was a backend engineer with minimal mobile experience, but they needed help with API integration and testing.
>
> **Task:** I needed to contribute meaningfully without slowing them down or making errors in unfamiliar territory.
>
> **Action:** I was upfront about my mobile limitations but offered to handle what I could do well: backend API fixes and writing integration tests. I pair programmed with mobile engineers for the first two days to understand their codebase patterns. I asked lots of "why" questions to understand mobile-specific constraints like network reliability and battery usage. For tasks that touched mobile-specific code, I created detailed PRs with context and asked for thorough review. I also documented what I learned to help the next backend engineer who might need to contribute.
>
> **Result:** I completed the API integration work and wrote a comprehensive test suite. The mobile team said having backend support, even partial, was hugely helpful. Two months later, when our backend team was short-handed, a mobile engineer returned the favor. I learned that you don't need to be an expert to contribute—you need to be humble, ask good questions, and leverage what you do know.

### Q8: Tell me about a time you improved team collaboration or culture.

**What they're looking for:**
- Initiative in team-building
- Creating positive work environment
- Long-term thinking about team health

**Example Answer (STAR):**

> **Situation:** Our team was highly productive but siloed—everyone worked independently, code reviews were perfunctory, and there was little knowledge sharing. When someone went on vacation, their work was blocked.
>
> **Task:** I wanted to build more collaboration and shared knowledge without mandating processes people would resist.
>
> **Action:** I started small and voluntary. I proposed "learning lunches" once a week where someone would demo what they were working on—no formal presentation, just screen-sharing and Q&A. I went first to set a casual tone. After three weeks, I noticed people were naturally discussing approaches and offering help. I introduced "office hours" where anyone could ask for help debugging or designing. I also started a Slack channel for sharing interesting articles or solutions. When these caught on, I proposed ensemble programming sessions for complex features—three engineers, one keyboard, rotating driver.
>
> **Result:** Team collaboration improved measurably. Code review quality increased because people understood each other's work. The knowledge-sharing meant vacation coverage became easy. Most importantly, engineers reported higher satisfaction and learning. Two of these practices spread to other teams organically. I learned that culture change works best when it's bottom-up, voluntary, and demonstrably valuable.

### Q9: Describe a time when you had to depend on someone who wasn't reliable.

**What they're looking for:**
- Problem-solving around difficult dependencies
- Professionalism despite frustration
- Risk mitigation

**Example Answer (STAR):**

> **Situation:** I was building a feature that required data from another team's API. The engineer responsible often missed meetings, delayed deliverables, and was unresponsive to Slack messages. We had a hard deadline.
>
> **Task:** I needed to deliver my feature on time despite the unreliable dependency.
>
> **Action:** I didn't escalate immediately or complain to their manager. First, I documented exactly what I needed and when, with clear specifications. I sent this via email (creating a paper trail) and offered to help implement it if they were swamped. When that didn't get traction, I built a mock API that matched the expected interface so I could develop and test my feature. I kept the scope small and achievable. I also had a backup plan: if their API wasn't ready by our code freeze, I'd ship my feature with the mock and swap in the real API post-launch. I communicated this plan to my manager and theirs.
>
> **Result:** The existence of my mock and the visibility to their manager motivated them to deliver—they shipped three days before our deadline. My feature launched on time. Their manager appreciated that I'd been professional rather than escalating with complaints. I learned that depending on unreliable people requires documentation, buffer time, and backup plans—not just hope.

### Q10: Tell me about a time you celebrated or recognized a teammate's contribution.

**What they're looking for:**
- Generosity and team spirit
- Recognition of others' work
- Building positive relationships

**Example Answer (STAR):**

> **Situation:** A junior engineer on our team solved a particularly nasty bug that had been plaguing us for weeks. It was excellent detective work, but they were quiet and unlikely to self-promote.
>
> **Task:** I wanted to make sure their contribution was recognized beyond just our immediate team.
>
> **Action:** I posted in our engineering-wide Slack channel describing the bug, its impact, and the clever solution they found. I made sure to detail the problem-solving process they used, not just the fix. I also mentioned it to their manager in our next sync. During our team retro, I called it out as a great example of persistence and debugging skill. I encouraged them to write a blog post about it for our engineering blog.
>
> **Result:** They received praise from senior engineers across the org and their manager mentioned it in their performance review. They told me later it was a confidence boost that made them feel like they belonged on the team. The blog post they wrote became one of our most-read internal posts. I learned that recognizing others' work costs nothing but means everything—and it builds a culture where people want to contribute.
