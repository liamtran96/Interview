# Time Management

Time management questions assess how you prioritize work, handle competing demands, and deliver under pressure.

## Common Questions

### Q1: Tell me about a time you had to manage multiple priorities.

**What they're looking for:**
- Systematic prioritization approach
- Communication with stakeholders
- Delivering results despite competing demands

**Example Answer (STAR):**

> **Situation:** I was leading a feature release while simultaneously being the primary on-call for our production systems. Midweek, we had two incidents that required my attention while I had committed deliverables due Friday.
>
> **Task:** I needed to handle the incidents, deliver the feature, and communicate clearly with everyone depending on me.
>
> **Action:** I first triaged by impact: incidents affecting customers came first. After stabilizing production, I assessed my feature work and identified which parts I could complete and which needed more time. I proactively messaged my manager and the PM with an updated timeline, explaining the situation and proposing to ship the core feature Friday with enhancements the following Monday. I then blocked my calendar, declined non-essential meetings, and focused on the critical path.
>
> **Result:** The incidents were resolved without customer impact. The core feature shipped Friday, and enhancements followed Monday as planned. Both my manager and PM appreciated the proactive communication. I learned that early, honest communication about trade-offs is better than hoping you can do everything.

### Q2: Describe a time you had to meet a tight deadline.

**What they're looking for:**
- Working effectively under pressure
- Scope management and trade-offs
- Maintaining quality despite time constraints

**Example Answer (STAR):**

> **Situation:** A major client requested a custom integration, and sales committed to a two-week deadline without consulting engineering. The work normally would take a month.
>
> **Task:** I was assigned to lead the integration and needed to find a way to deliver something valuable in the committed timeframe.
>
> **Action:** I immediately met with the client to understand their must-haves vs. nice-to-haves. I learned that three of the ten requested features drove 90% of their use case. I proposed delivering those three in two weeks, with the rest in a follow-up phase. I created a detailed day-by-day plan, identified risks upfront, and negotiated to have a QA engineer dedicated to the project. I also set up daily check-ins with the client to catch issues early.
>
> **Result:** We delivered the core integration on time, and the client was thrilled—they could start using it immediately. The remaining features were delivered three weeks later. The client became one of our biggest advocates. I learned that understanding the true need behind a request often reveals a faster path to value.

### Q3: Tell me about a time you had to say no or push back on a request.

**What they're looking for:**
- Setting appropriate boundaries
- Professional pushback with reasoning
- Offering alternatives

**Example Answer (STAR):**

> **Situation:** A product manager asked me to add "just one more feature" to our upcoming release, two days before the code freeze. The feature was small but would require changes to a critical payment path.
>
> **Task:** I needed to decline the request in a way that preserved our relationship and explained the real risk.
>
> **Action:** Instead of just saying no, I walked the PM through my concerns: changes to payment code require extra testing, and two days wasn't enough for proper QA. I pulled up data on past incidents from rushed payment changes. I then offered alternatives: we could ship it in the next release (two weeks away), or I could implement a feature flag now and enable it after thorough testing post-launch.
>
> **Result:** The PM chose the feature flag approach. The feature launched a week after release with zero issues. The PM later told me they appreciated that I didn't just block them but helped find a solution. I learned that "no" is more effective when paired with alternatives and evidence.

### Q4: Describe how you prioritize your work when everything seems urgent.

**What they're looking for:**
- Clear prioritization framework
- Distinguishing urgent from important
- Making and communicating decisions

**Example Answer (STAR):**

> **Situation:** During a high-pressure quarter, I had a major feature to ship, was mentoring a new hire, had been asked to participate in interviews, and had several production bugs assigned to me. My manager was out on leave.
>
> **Task:** I needed to figure out what to focus on and what to defer or delegate.
>
> **Action:** I listed everything and categorized by urgency and importance. Customer-affecting bugs were urgent and important—I addressed those first. The feature deadline was fixed, so I blocked focused time each day for it. I renegotiated interview participation from four per week to two. For mentoring, I shifted from daily check-ins to twice weekly, with async support via Slack. I sent my skip-level manager an email explaining my prioritization and asking them to tell me if I had it wrong.
>
> **Result:** I shipped the feature on time, resolved all critical bugs, and my mentee still rated the onboarding experience highly. The skip-level appreciated the transparency and validated my priorities. I learned that proactively communicating priorities gets stakeholders aligned and reduces surprise conflicts.

### Q5: Tell me about a time you missed a deadline.

**What they're looking for:**
- Honesty about failure
- How you handled the aftermath
- What you learned and changed

**Example Answer (STAR):**

> **Situation:** I committed to delivering a refactoring project in four weeks but discovered midway that the scope was larger than I'd estimated. I missed the deadline by two weeks.
>
> **Task:** I needed to deliver the project, manage stakeholder expectations, and understand what went wrong in my planning.
>
> **Action:** As soon as I realized the delay was likely, I communicated it—not when I missed the deadline. I explained what I'd discovered, gave a realistic new timeline, and offered to adjust scope if the original deadline was critical. I completed the project with the extra time. Afterward, I did a personal retrospective: I had estimated based on the "happy path" without accounting for the legacy code complexity I discovered.
>
> **Result:** The project was delivered two weeks late but with high quality. Stakeholders were disappointed but appreciated the early warning. I now build in exploration time for refactoring projects and do a technical spike before committing to timelines. I haven't missed a deadline since implementing this practice.

## Key Themes to Demonstrate

| Theme | How to Show It |
|-------|----------------|
| **Prioritization** | Clear framework for deciding what comes first |
| **Communication** | Proactive updates when timelines change |
| **Focus** | Ability to block time and avoid distractions |
| **Trade-offs** | Making smart scope decisions |
| **Boundaries** | Saying no professionally when necessary |

## Prioritization Framework

When asked how you prioritize, demonstrate a clear approach:

1. **Urgency** - What has a hard deadline or immediate impact?
2. **Importance** - What has the highest value or risk?
3. **Dependencies** - What blocks others or is blocked by others?
4. **Effort** - Can quick wins free up time for larger tasks?

**Eisenhower Matrix:**
| | Urgent | Not Urgent |
|---|--------|------------|
| **Important** | Do First | Schedule |
| **Not Important** | Delegate | Eliminate |

## Stories to Prepare

Have at least 2-3 stories ready that demonstrate:

- [ ] Managing competing priorities
- [ ] Delivering under a tight deadline
- [ ] Pushing back on unreasonable requests
- [ ] Your approach to prioritization
- [ ] Handling a missed deadline professionally
