# Frontend Security

## Overview

Frontend security is crucial for protecting users and applications from various attacks and vulnerabilities. This section covers essential security concepts, authentication mechanisms, common vulnerabilities, and best practices for building secure web applications.

## What You'll Learn

- **JWT Authentication**: Token-based authentication, implementation patterns, security considerations
- **XSS/CSRF Protection**: Understanding and preventing cross-site attacks
- **Secure Data Handling**: Best practices for storing sensitive information
- **HTTPS/CORS**: Secure communication and cross-origin resource sharing
- **Common Vulnerabilities**: OWASP Top 10 frontend-specific issues
- **Security Best Practices**: CSP, input validation, secure coding patterns

## Learning Path

1. Start with **Authentication & JWT** to understand token-based auth fundamentals
2. Learn **XSS/CSRF Protection** to defend against common attacks
3. Study **Secure Data Handling** for proper storage of sensitive data
4. Understand **HTTPS/CORS** for secure communication
5. Review **Common Vulnerabilities** to recognize security risks
6. Master **Security Best Practices** for building secure applications

## Interview Preparation Tips

- Focus on practical implementation, not just theory
- Understand trade-offs between different security approaches
- Be ready to discuss real-world security scenarios
- Know the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- Practice explaining security concepts clearly

## Key Concepts

### Defense in Depth
Multiple layers of security controls throughout an application to protect against attacks.

### Principle of Least Privilege
Users and systems should have only the minimum access necessary to perform their functions.

### Input Validation
Never trust user input - always validate and sanitize data from external sources.

### Security by Design
Build security into the application from the start, not as an afterthought.
