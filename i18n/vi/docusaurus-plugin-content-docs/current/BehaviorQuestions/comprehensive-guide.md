# Comprehensive Behavioral Interview Guide

**Candidate:** Tran Khac Quyet (Liam)
**Role:** Senior Frontend Developer

## How to Use This Document

1. Fill in your real experiences in the [YOUR EXPERIENCE] sections
2. Follow the STAR format: Situation → Task → Action → Result
3. Practice speaking each answer in 60-90 seconds
4. Keep 1-2 specific numbers/metrics if you have them

---

## Q1: Tell me about yourself and your experience

### Your Answer:

I've been doing frontend development for about 3 and a half years, mostly with React and TypeScript. I've spent most of that time building data-heavy SaaS platforms — things like CRM systems and booking platforms.

Beyond just writing features, I focus a lot on performance and maintainability — I actually enjoy making code faster and easier to work with.

I'm looking for my next challenge where I can contribute to architecture decisions and help raise the bar on technical quality. That's actually what drew me to the engineering culture here at DGW ASIA.

### Tips for delivery:
- Practice saying "three and a half years" naturally
- Sound conversational, not like reading a script
- If they ask follow-up, be ready to give specific examples

---

## Q2: Describe a challenging technical problem you solved

### Template (STAR Format):

**S - Situation:** What was the context? What project?

**T - Task:** What was the problem? Why was it challenging?

**A - Action:** What did YOU do? (Be specific about your steps)

**R - Result:** What was the outcome? Any metrics?

### Your Answer:

**Situation:** [YOUR EXPERIENCE - What project? What company? When?]

**Task / Problem:** [YOUR EXPERIENCE - What was broken/slow/difficult? Why did it matter?]

**Action (What YOU Did):**
- [YOUR EXPERIENCE - Step 1: ...]
- [YOUR EXPERIENCE - Step 2: ...]
- [YOUR EXPERIENCE - Step 3: ...]

**Result:** [YOUR EXPERIENCE - What improved? Any numbers? What did team/users say?]

### Example Answer (for reference):

So at DGW, we had this table component in our CRM that users kept complaining about — it was really laggy and slow.

The thing was, the component was like 2000 lines of code and nobody wanted to touch it. My job was to fix the performance without breaking anything.

First thing I did was profile it with React DevTools to actually see what was going on — not just guess. Turned out it was re-rendering everything on every state change. So I broke it into smaller components, added proper memoization where it made sense, and used virtualization for large datasets.

End result? About 25% faster rendering. Users noticed right away. And bonus — the code was way easier to maintain after that.

## Q3: How do you handle disagreements with team members about technical decisions?

### Your Answer:

I try to listen first and understand where the other person is coming from before pushing my own view.

Actually, early in my career, I found this simple CSS bug and just fixed it — seemed obvious to me. But my team lead pulled me aside and said I shouldn't touch other people's code without talking to them first, even for small stuff. At first I was like, "it's just CSS, what's the big deal?"

But he explained that in a big codebase, even small changes can break things you don't know about — maybe that CSS was written that way on purpose for some edge case. He told me something that really stuck: "Put the team's benefit above your personal benefit."

Since then, I always communicate first before changing shared code. I learned that disagreements usually aren't about who's right — they're about seeing the bigger picture that I might be missing.

### Why this answer works:
- Shows you can admit when you were wrong
- Shows you learned and grew from feedback
- Shows you understand team dynamics over individual speed
- Ends with a lesson learned — interviewers love this

### Shorter version (30 seconds):

Early on, I fixed a "simple" CSS bug without asking, and my lead explained why that's risky — even small changes can break things you don't know about. He said to put team benefit above personal speed. That really stuck with me. Now I always communicate first, even for small stuff.

### Key lesson to emphasize:

"I learned that being fast is not the same as being helpful. Sometimes the right move is to slow down and communicate."

## Q4: How do you prioritize when you have multiple urgent tasks?

### Template:

1. Your framework/approach (2-3 sentences)
2. Specific example
3. How you communicate about priorities

### Your Answer:

**Your Approach:** [YOUR EXPERIENCE - How do you decide what to do first?]

**Specific Example:**
- **Situation:** [YOUR EXPERIENCE - When did you have multiple urgent tasks?]
- **How You Prioritized:** [YOUR EXPERIENCE - What did you do first? Why?]
- **Result:** [YOUR EXPERIENCE - Did everything get done? What happened?]

**How You Communicate:** [YOUR EXPERIENCE - How do you keep stakeholders informed?]

### Example Answer (for reference):

First thing I do is figure out what "urgent" actually means — because honestly, different people have different definitions. Then I look at what affects users most, what's blocking other people, and what has a real deadline.

Like at ZENS, I was in the middle of a feature when a production bug came up. I quickly wrote down where I stopped — what I was doing, what's left — then switched to the bug. That documentation saved me a lot of time when I came back to the feature.

I also try to communicate early. If I can't do everything, I tell people right away instead of just missing deadlines quietly. And I time-box my debugging — if I'm stuck for an hour, I escalate instead of burning time alone.

## Q5: Describe a project you're most proud of

### Template:

1. What was the project? (1-2 sentences)
2. Why are you proud? What made it special?
3. Your specific contributions
4. The impact/result

### Your Answer:

**The Project:** [YOUR EXPERIENCE - What did you build? For whom?]

**Why You're Proud:** [YOUR EXPERIENCE - What made this special to you?]

**Your Contributions:** [YOUR EXPERIENCE - What specifically did YOU do?]

**Impact/Result:** [YOUR EXPERIENCE - What was the outcome? Is it still being used?]

### Example Answer (for reference):

Probably XLogistics — it's a transport management system I built from scratch.

What made it special is that I owned the whole thing, from database design to frontend deployment. It wasn't just building a feature in someone else's app — it was a complete product.

I designed over 50 database migrations with Row Level Security so different roles see different data — drivers only see their own trips, operators see the whole fleet, owners see the financials. Built like 40+ reusable React components, real-time notifications, analytics dashboard, the whole thing.

It's production-ready with real security, not just a demo. That project really showed me I can architect complete systems, not just build features.

## Q6: Why do you quit your job? / Why are you leaving?

### Tips:
- Stay **positive** — never badmouth current/previous company
- Focus on what you're moving **toward**, not running **from**
- Keep it short — 2-3 sentences is enough

### Your Answer:

So, I'm at an outsourcing company right now, and you know how it is — projects come and go. My last project ended about 2 months ago, and I've been between projects since then. Rather than just waiting around, I figured this is a good time to look for something more stable.

I'm also excited to take on new challenges in a more international environment where English is used daily.

### Shorter version:

My company is outsourcing, so projects aren't always stable — I've been between projects for about 2 months now. I'm looking for something more stable, and honestly, I'm excited to work in a more international environment.

### If they ask follow-up questions:

| Question | Your Answer |
|----------|-------------|
| "Why international environment?" | "I want to challenge myself, work with diverse teams, and grow beyond my comfort zone" |
| "Are you still employed?" | "Yes, I'm still with the company but currently between projects" |
| "Any issues with the company?" | "No issues — it's just the nature of outsourcing. I'm grateful for the experience, but I'm ready for something more stable" |

### ❌ Avoid saying:
- "I have nothing to do" (sounds lazy)
- "The company has no projects" (sounds like company is failing)
- "I'm bored" (negative)

### ✅ Good framing:
- "Between projects" (professional way to say no current work)
- "Looking for stability" (positive reason)
- "Take on new challenges" (shows ambition)
- "International environment" (shows growth mindset)

## Q7: What is your expectation in the next company?

### Tips:
- Show you've thought about your career
- Align your expectations with what the company offers
- Balance personal growth with contributing to the team

### Your Answer:

Honestly, I just want to work with a team that cares about doing things right — clean code, good testing, proper code reviews. Not just shipping fast and moving on, you know?

I also want to keep growing technically — working with modern tech, learning new patterns, solving complex problems. And over time, I'd like to move into a senior or lead role where I can help shape technical decisions.

### Shorter version:

I'm looking for a team that actually values code quality. I also want to keep growing technically and eventually move into a senior or lead role.

### If they ask follow-up questions:

| Question | Your Answer |
|----------|-------------|
| "What do you mean by code quality?" | "Things like code reviews, testing, consistent patterns — a codebase people can maintain" |
| "What tech do you want to learn?" | "I'm open — whatever helps me solve problems better. Recently interested in performance optimization and architecture patterns" |
| "Where do you see yourself in 3 years?" | "In a senior or lead role, helping with architecture decisions and mentoring others" |

## Q8: Why do you think you're a good fit for this role?

### Tips:
- Match YOUR skills to THEIR requirements
- Give specific examples, not just claims
- Show you understand what the role needs

### Structure to follow:

1. "Based on the job description..." (show you did research)
2. Match your skills to their needs
3. "I believe I can contribute right away" (close with confidence)

### Your Answer:

From what I saw in the job description, you're looking for someone with solid React experience who cares about code quality and can work independently. That's pretty much what I've been doing for the past 3 years — building complex SaaS platforms, optimizing performance, and I've also mentored teams along the way. I'm pretty confident I can contribute right away.

### Shorter version:

I've spent 3+ years doing exactly this — React, complex platforms, focusing on performance and code quality. I can work independently and I've mentored others too. I think I can hit the ground running.

### If they ask follow-up questions:

| Question | Your Answer |
|----------|-------------|
| "What makes you stand out?" | "I don't just build features — I care about performance and maintainability. I've optimized slow components and set up testing practices" |
| "Can you work independently?" | "Yes, I've owned features end-to-end and recently built a full-stack project from scratch" |
| "How fast can you contribute?" | "I'm familiar with your tech stack, so I believe I can start contributing within the first few weeks" |

## Q9: How is Scrum applied in your team? / Tell me about your experience with Agile/Scrum

### Tips:
- Show you understand Scrum ceremonies and roles
- Give specific examples from your team
- Mention what worked well and any improvements you contributed

### Your Answer:

We do Scrum with 2-week sprints. So every sprint starts with planning where we break down user stories and estimate with story points. We have daily standups — about 15 minutes — just to share what we're working on and if anything's blocking us. Then at the end of each sprint, we do a demo for stakeholders and a retro to talk about what went well and what we can do better.

For task assignment, it really depends on the project. Some projects the lead assigns based on people's skills and workload. Other projects we just pick tasks ourselves from the backlog. I've done both and I'm fine either way.

### Shorter version:

We use Scrum with 2-week sprints — planning, daily standups, demo, and retro. Task assignment depends on the project: sometimes the lead assigns, sometimes we self-pick. I'm comfortable with both.

### Key Scrum terms to know:

| Term | What it means |
|------|--------------|
| **Sprint** | Fixed time period (usually 1-2 weeks) to complete work |
| **Sprint Planning** | Team decides what to work on this sprint |
| **Daily Standup** | 15-min daily sync: what I did, what I'll do, blockers |
| **Sprint Review/Demo** | Show completed work to stakeholders |
| **Retrospective** | Team reflects: what went well, what to improve |
| **Backlog Grooming** | Refine and estimate upcoming work |
| **Story Points** | Relative estimate of effort (not hours) |
| **Product Owner** | Prioritizes backlog, represents business |
| **Scrum Master** | Facilitates process, removes blockers |

### Task Assignment Methods:

| Method | When it's used |
|--------|---------------|
| **Lead assigns** | Complex projects, need balanced workload, junior team members |
| **Self-assignment** | Experienced team, gives more ownership |
| **Skill-based** | Specific expertise needed (e.g., performance → senior dev) |

### If they ask follow-up questions:

| Question | Your Answer |
|----------|-------------|
| "What's your sprint length?" | "2 weeks" |
| "How do you estimate?" | "Story points using planning poker" |
| "What happens when something urgent comes mid-sprint?" | "We discuss with PO, swap out lower priority items if needed" |
| "What do you do in retrospectives?" | "Discuss what went well, what didn't, and pick 1-2 things to improve next sprint" |

## Q10: How do you estimate time for a task?

### Tips:
- Show you have a logical approach
- Mention that you account for unknowns
- Be honest that estimates aren't always perfect

### Your Answer:

So first, I break the task down into smaller pieces — like if it's a feature, I think about the UI, the logic, API integration, testing, all that. It's much easier to estimate small chunks than one big thing.

Then I think about what I already know and what's new. If it's something I've done before, I can estimate pretty confidently. But if there's something unfamiliar — like a new library or a tricky integration — I add some buffer time because there's always stuff you don't expect.

I also think about things like code review and QA. A lot of people forget that, but it's part of getting the task done. And honestly, if I'm really unsure, I'll just say "I need a couple hours to investigate before I can give a good estimate." That's better than guessing wrong.

### Real Example: Estimate a "User Profile Edit" Feature

**Task:** Build a page where users can edit their profile (name, email, avatar)

#### Step 1: Break it down

| Sub-task | Estimate |
|----------|----------|
| UI layout (form, inputs, buttons) | 2 hours |
| Form validation (required fields, email format) | 1 hour |
| Avatar upload component | 2 hours |
| API integration (GET current data, PUT update) | 2 hours |
| Loading & error states | 1 hour |
| Unit tests | 2 hours |
| Code review fixes | 1 hour |
| **Total** | **11 hours** |

#### Step 2: Add buffer for unknowns

| Risk | Buffer |
|------|--------|
| Avatar upload — never done before, might have issues | +2 hours |
| API might change or have edge cases | +1 hour |
| **Buffer total** | **+3 hours** |

#### Step 3: Final estimate

**11 + 3 = 14 hours ≈ 2 days**

### How to explain it naturally:

"For example, if I need to build a profile edit page, I'd break it down: UI is maybe 2 hours, form validation 1 hour, avatar upload 2 hours, API integration 2 hours, error handling 1 hour, tests 2 hours, and code review fixes 1 hour. That's about 11 hours.

But avatar upload is something I haven't done in this project before, so I'd add a couple hours buffer. Same with API — there might be edge cases. So I'd estimate around 2 days total."

### Shorter version:

I break it into smaller pieces first — it's easier to estimate small chunks. Then I consider what's familiar versus what's new, and add buffer for unknowns. I also factor in code review and testing. If I'm really unsure, I'll ask for time to investigate before committing to an estimate.

### If they ask follow-up questions:

| Question | Your Answer |
|----------|-------------|
| "What if you underestimate?" | "I communicate early. If I realize it's taking longer, I let the team know right away instead of waiting until the deadline" |
| "How accurate are your estimates?" | "Not always perfect, but I've gotten better by tracking how long things actually take and learning from that" |
| "Do you use story points or hours?" | "Both, depending on the team. Story points for sprint planning, sometimes hours for specific tasks" |

### Key points to mention:

- **Break it down** — smaller pieces are easier to estimate
- **Account for unknowns** — new tech, integrations, edge cases
- **Include everything** — code review, testing, QA
- **Communicate early** — if estimate is wrong, tell the team ASAP
